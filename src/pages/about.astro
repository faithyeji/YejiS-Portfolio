        ...current USC student and 1 of 42 members in the 9th cohort of the Iovine and Young Academy, studying integrated Computer Science and Design.

      <p class="mt-5">
        I started my journey in college as a designer who fell in love with software and its infinite potential to create. As I studied computer science and graphics, I found my true passion: prototyping in the great, sometimes-silly space where technology and art collide. 
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5">
        My philosophies: <br/>
        1. never losing childish wonder and curiosity in learning.<br/>
        2. working and studying in intersections.<br/>
        3. trying to leave things better than I found them.

        I’m always just an email away. Let’s create some magic together. 🪄✨
